# Network Engineering Vocabulary

## Purpose

Technical employees use specialized vocabulary at work.  Some of these
terms are likely unfamiliar to captioning professionals, court
reporters, and others who may prefer to know terminology in advance of
captioning/transcription jobs.

Often, however, if a captioner asks an engineer, "What vocabulary will
you use?" many words may be left out.  This is to help provide a
starting point for those discussions.

## How This Guide Works

This guide is divided by general technical domain, with each technical
domain having their own pages. Some terms may be common across multiple
domains, and seen on multiple pages.  Multiple domains may be relevant
to a given captioning task, but likely not all will (should this guide
expand).
